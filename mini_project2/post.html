            <p  >The most notorious and attention-seeking word ever created by the government and matrix is 'Alien'.
Ever wonder who they are, why they have a specific name 'Alien', how they look, what they do, and where is the origin of these creepy monsters ???
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The keyword of this short thesis is 'believe'.
                    When you make people to think or to believe on something, they will do it blindly!
                    
                    In history, there were many incidents where we heard about the alien and their spaceships. Everywhere in social media or T.V(media) we have seen Unidentified Flying Objects(UFOs). Influencers are having debates on these freaking topics every day 24*7 as if they are close relatives of Alien and they have asked them for their Biography!
                    </p>
                <img src="img1.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            <p>I always wonder, if aliens are present on this planet Earth then where are they?? Are they playing hide&seek with humans or are they hiding themselves from "Kamla Harris"? // It was funny hehehehehahaha.....
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Just think for once that if we never saw an alien then how can people describe their physical appearance,(like we see in movies that they are short, creepy, bighead, wearing no clothes, and even they have no organs ! )
                <!-- Motherf*cker how do they reproduce? -->
                </p>
            <br>
            <blockquote class="quote">
                <p>
                    <span><i class="ri-double-quotes-l"></i></span>
                    Maybe the real question isn’t if aliens exist, but why we haven’t met them yet.<span><i class="ri-double-quotes-r"></i>

            <br>
            <p>Now let me tell you a shocking fact that in past 100 years, over 500 + movies have been made on this Non-existential topic 'Alien'. And you can't imagine the total box office collection that had been made from this trivial topic.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Let me give you a taste of it:-
                There is a Movie Alien: Romulus which earned nearly $403.3 million
                A single movie!
                Now clear everything from your mind and just try to look behind the scenes,'' Who is earning from this''? You or me or poor people or middle-class people, who??
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="img2.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                <p>The answer is f*cking Government and Rich people.
                    Have you ever heard of rich people talking about alien or paranormal activities or Environment pollution or all this bullshit??
                    </p>
                    <p>Yes if these things are bringing money into their pocket otherwise they don't give a shit. But we do, why? because of curiosity about "What if they exist".
                        That's why the rich are getting richer and we don't. Government and their agents are feeding to our mind that Glaciers are melting and a day will come when this planet will be covered by water completely. If it will, then why rich people are buying houses on the seaside? are they fools?
                        </p>
                        <br>
                <p>Now coming back to our topic "Alien". It is just a fascinating story that helps the government make money.
                    Well, according to me "Any unknown species known to humans are referred to as alien".
                    There might be a possibility that just like humans, there are more humans present in any other planet of any other galaxy of any other Universe. You can call them aliens and likewise, they can call us aliens. They might look different or they might have different textures but what matters is that they are also living beings just like we are.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <p>
                    They might not have as much anger as we have.
                    Right now there is no evidence of them and everything is prediction and prediction might be wrong.
                    
                    ...............that was my prediction.</p>
